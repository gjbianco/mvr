mvr - minimum viable reddit

## About

mvr strives to be the minimum extra features you need to make browsing reddit comfortable. It takes inspiration from Reddit Enhancement Suite (RES) and came about due to the latter dropping support for Safari. It does not (and will not) attempt to recreate the vast majority of RES.

mvr mainly focuses on adding basic navigation keyboard controls (see below). Speed is another focus.

## Support

mvr consists of a small JavaScript file. This allows it to be snappy and work cross-browser. 

Currently, there is only a build for Safari, but Chrome and Firefox should be coming next.

## Controls

j - select next post
k - select previous post
h - toggle in-line viewing ("expando")
l - open post in a new tab

m - open comments in a new tab
. - go to next page
, - go to previous page
